            This game was created for a game jam where the theme was <strong>"chains"</strong> and the game had to be made within
            a two-day window. There were three people on the team: myself (as game designer, lead programmer, and team lead), 
            and two others who handled graphics and audio.
            </p>

            This project taught me a lot about managing and leading a team under a tight deadline. I was responsible not only 
            for programming all the systems but also for coordinating the whole project and ensuring we stayed on track. 
            Despite the time constraints, we successfully released a playable demo by the deadline.
            </p>
