                This game was made during a game jam with the theme being duality. This theme is present through the
                gameplay and visuals. In the game, the player must jump through the level, and every time they jump, they
                switch the world to the opposite color. When the world switches, new platforms are available to the player.
                The world alternates between light and dark with every jump.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game was created within a 2-day game jam. At the end of the jam, a playable demo was available, showcasing
                the core gameplay that incorporated the duality theme. The main feature is the changing available platforms
                each time the player jumps. This experience taught me valuable lessons in time management, game development
                processes, and handling unexpected challenges during development.

            The game challenges players with alternating platforms and environments, using the light and dark worlds to create dynamic
            gameplay. Players must quickly adapt to the changing conditions to progress through the levels.

            The design of Light & Dark Game focuses on balancing puzzle and platforming elements. Players must use their
            environment to their advantage, switching worlds at the right moment to create paths and avoid obstacles.

            This game was my first time participating in a game jam, and it was an exciting experience. I learned how to create
            a game from start to finish within a limited timeframe, focusing on core mechanics, visual design, and user feedback.
